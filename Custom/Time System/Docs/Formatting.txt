Here is a list of the formatting variables:

$yr$      This will display the year.


$yr-#$    This will display the year where # is how many digits of the year to display, starting
          from the right.

          For example: $yr-2$ for year 2006 would display 06.


$mo$      This will display the number of the current month.


$mo-0$    This will display the full name of a month.

          For example: $mo-0$ for month 2 would display February.


$mo-3$    This will display the first three letters of the month.

          For example: $mo-3$ for month 2 would display Feb.


$da$      This will display the day.


$da-#$    This will display the day where # is how many digits of the day to display.

          For example: $da-2$ for day 7 would be 07.


$hr$      This will display the hour.


$hr-#$    This will display the hour where # is how many digits of the hour to display.

          For example: $hr-2$ for hour 3 would be 03.


$hr-ap$   This will display the hour using AM/PM hours (typically called 12h format, but if you have
          a custom set of hours such as 36, it would half 36 and be 18h format).

          For example: $hr-ap$ for hour 20 would display 8.  This will not display AM/PM.  You will
          need to use the $ap$ variable for that.


$mn$      This will display the minute.


$mn-#$    This will display the minute where # is how many digits of the minute to display.

          For example: $mn-2$ for minute 2 would be 02.


$mp-#$    This will display the moon phase for the specified custom moon #.

          For example: The moon #1 Trammel is full, so $mp-1$ will display "full"

$cmn-#$   This will display the name of the specified custom moon #.  This will only work when
          m_UseCustomMoons is true.

          For example: The moon #2's name is Felucca, so $cmn-2$ would display "Felucca"


$ap$      This will display AM or PM based on the time of day.

          For example:  The hour is 15 (3 PM) so $ap$ will display "PM"


$nth-d$   This will display the "th", "st", "nd", or "rd" based on the day.

          For example: $nth-d$ for day 3 would display "rd"


$nth-m$   This will display the "th", "st", "nd", or "rd" based on the month.

          For example: $nth-m$ for month 7 would display "th"


$$        This will add an extra space.


Formatting examples:

Example 1:
2/18/2006 11:30 AM
"It is $hr-ap$:$mn-2$ $ap$ on the $da$$nth-d$ day of $mo-0$, $yr$."

Would display:
"It is 11:30 AM on the 18th day of February, 2006."


Example 2:
1/3/104 5:24 PM. Moon is waxing first quarter.
"The time is $hr-ap$:$mn-2$ $ap$ on day $da$ of month $mo$ of year $yr$. The moon is $mp-0$."

Would display:
"The time is 5:24 PM on day 3 of month 1 of year 104. The moon is waxing first quarter."


Example 3:
4/13/251 3:02 PM
"The current time is $hr$:$mn-2$ on $mo$/$da$/$yr$."

Would display:
"The current time is 15:02 on 4/13/251."


Example 4:
8/21/209 5:24 PM. Custom moon #1 Trammel is waxing half.
"It is $hr-ap$:$mn-2$ $ap$ on day $da$ of month $mo$ of year $yr$. The moon $cmn-1$ is $mp-1$."

Would display:
"It is 5:24 PM on day 21 of month 8 of year 209. The moon Trammel is waxing half."

How to set the format for clock items:

[TS SET CLOCKTIMEFORMAT <format>

Example:
[TS SET CLOCKTIMEFORMAT It is $hr-ap$:$mn-2$ $ap$ on the $da$$nth-d$ day of $mo-0$, $yr$.


How to set the format for spyglasses:

[TS SET SPYGLASSFORMAT <format>
